Welcome to my projects.First put the MyFirstApp-main in you documents folder. Then, run the start.py to get started. The projects come in Golang, Python3, Java, and C++. Each one has a different twist to it.(Note:Python3 and java work in progress) If java isn't working, do this:
On Windows:
set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdkYOURJAVAVERSION\bin
On MACOS on Linux:
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home
Then do echo $JAVA_HOME to check the path.

Make sure that you have g++(already on mac and some linux environments), golang (1.11 or above), python3, and java install on your system.(Note: python2 comes preinstalled on mac. You need python3)
