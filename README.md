Welcome to my projects.First put the MyFirstApp-main in you documents folder. Then, run pip3 install pyinput. After that, run the start.py to get started. The projects come in Golang, Python3, and C++. Each one has a different twist to it.(Note:Python3 work in progress)

Make sure that you have g++(already on mac and some linux environments), golang (1.11 or above), python3, and java install on your system.(Note: python2 comes preinstalled on mac. You need python3)
